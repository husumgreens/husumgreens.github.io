            <h2 id="1.INTRODUCTION">1. INTRODUCTION</h2>
            <h3 id="1.1.SummaryOfGuidelines">1.1. SUMMARY OF GUIDELINES</h3>
            <p> This document contains the architectural guidelines and standards for the
                Husum Greens subdivision. Pursuant to Article 7 of the Declaration, the
                Architectural Review Committee ("ARC") adopts the below-listed
                Architectural Standards Manual and Guidelines governing each Lot built or
                improved after plat recordation.
            </p>
            <p>While individual Owners retain the right to design and build a home consistent with their needs and
                choices, it is also important that certain standards and guidelines are in place to ensure that there is
                general architectural consistency from Lot to Lot, and that guidance can be provided to Owners as they
                seek to build on their Lot or make modifications to an existing Improvement.</p>
            <p>To this end, the following Architectural Standards Manual and Guidelines are to be used by the ARC in
                evaluating plans and specifications under the Declaration concerning those Improvements, including
                structures and landscaping. It is the responsibility of the ARC to review an Owner's submittals with
                specific reference to the following standards and guidelines.</p>
            <p>The standards and guidelines recognize that each Lot may present certain unique circumstances which
                should be taken into account by the ARC in administering the standards and guidelines, but that a
                general architectural and aesthetic appearance for Husum Greens also needs to be established and
                maintained. While cost considerations to an Owner can be taken into account by the ARC in reviewing
                plans and specifications, cost alone should not be a principal consideration for the ARC in its review.
            </p>
            <p>All terms used in the standards and guidelines shall have the defined meanings set forth in the
                Declaration. The ARC retains all rights to amend, modify, or revise the following standards and
                guidelines.</p>
            <h3 id="1.2.ThePurposeOfTheseGuidelines">1.2. THE PURPOSE OF THESE GUIDELINES</h3>
            <p>The specific objectives of this document are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>To illustrate basic design principles, which will aid Owners in developing exterior improvements and
                    structural changes that are in harmony with the immediate neighborhood and community as a whole.
                </li>
                <li>To provide uniform guidelines to be used by the ARC in reviewing applications in light of the goals
                    set forth in the governing documents of the community and the actions of the Board of Directors.
                </li>
                <li>To assist Owners in preparing an acceptable application to the ARC.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>To increase Owners' awareness and understanding of the Declaration.</p>
            <p>To describe the organization and procedures involved with the architectural standards.</p>
            <p>To provide guidelines that integrate the site's natural elements with residential home sites.</p>
            <p>To assist Owners in maintaining a well-kept community in order to protect and enhance the economic,
                property, and aesthetic values, and the overall desirability of the homes within the community.</p>
            <p>Any questions regarding these guidelines and procedures or application submissions should be directed to:

            <h3 id="1.3.TheUseOfTheseGuidelines">1.3. THE USE OF THESE GUIDELINES</h3>
            <p>Each application is to be reviewed on an individual basis before any project is scheduled to begin. The
                following types of projects need approval by the ARC:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Construction of homes on unbuilt Lots;</li>
                <li>Additions or alterations to structures, if visible from the exterior of the structure;</li>
                <li>Installations of Decks, Fences, Patios, Porch screening, Driveways, or Walls;</li>
                <li>Repainting a structure in a different color, if the color is not on the palette;</li>
                <li>Landscaping that involves changes in Lot elevations, removal of trees, plants that may block a
                    street view, creating a potential safety concern, or addition of shrubs or trees that constitute a
                    natural fence; or</li>
                <li>Addition of sheds, lean-tos, or other accessory buildings.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3 id="1.4.DesignReviewCriteria">1.4. DESIGN REVIEW CRITERIA</h3>
            <p>The following criteria outline the general standards that will be used in reviewing and evaluating such
                application for structural or design changes.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Validity of Concept:</strong> The basic idea must be sound and appropriate to its
                    surroundings.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Design Compatibility:</strong> The proposed Improvement must be compatible with the
                    architectural characteristics of the applicant's house, adjoining houses, and the neighborhood
                    setting. Compatibility is defined as similarity in architectural style, workmanship quality, and
                    similar material usage, color, and construction details. Because of recent significant advances in
                    panelized and modular construction techniques, customized designs incorporating these methods will
                    be evaluated on a case by case basis.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Building Classification:</strong> Only residential properties are allowed on Lots.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Location and Impact on Neighbors:</strong> The proposed home or any subsequent alteration
                    should relate favorably to the landscape, the existing structure when applicable, and the
                    neighborhood. The primary concerns include, but are not limited to, access, sunlight, ventilation,
                    and drainage. For example, (a) fences may not obstruct views, breezes, or access to a neighboring
                    property; (b) decks or larger additions may not cast unwanted shadows on an adjacent patio or
                    property or infringe on a neighbor's privacy; and (c) lighting may not cast unreasonable light on or
                    to adjacent properties. The size of the proposed alteration should relate well to adjacent
                    structures and their surroundings. For example, a large addition to a small house or construction of
                    a storage outbuilding may be inappropriate.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Color:</strong> Color may be used to soften or intensify visual impact. Similar portions of
                    an addition to an existing house, such as roofs, siding, and trim, should be matching in color.
                    Paint colors for shutters, entry doors, and garage doors must be one of the approved colors for the
                    community or one approved by the ARC. Wooden trim (e.g., eaves, fascia, window framing) and
                    gutters/downspouts must be approved by the ARC.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Materials:</strong> When proposing to extend or modify an existing home, continuity is
                    established by use of the same or compatible materials as were used in the original home. The
                    options may be limited by the design and materials of the original home.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3 id="1.5.MunicipalRegulatoryPrecedence">1.5. MUNICIPAL REGULATORY PRECEDENCE</h3>
            <p>All plans and specifications submitted to the ARC must be fully compliant with all legal standards,
                including those of Klickitat County. The ARC shall have no authority to make any exceptions to such
                standards. Any ARC decision which is subsequently found to be in conflict with such standards shall be
                voided, requiring the Owner to conform, at the Owner's expense, to such legal standards.</p>
